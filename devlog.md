Watched "Introduction to computer graphics lecture 2: Curves I".

Parameterized circle:

f(t) = (cos(t), sin(t))

lines can be thought of as 1d parameterized.

Implicit modeling:
all points such that some condition is true.


Parameterized vs. Implicit modeling 2 ways to represent geometry.
Vector vs. Raster Graphics
Simplicity of rendering vs. expressivness

Differential geometry

Most common type of curve:
Spline
comes from ship building - moisten wood - curve - spline

Determined by control points. Interpolate control points with curve and degrees of freedom.
Basis functions?
